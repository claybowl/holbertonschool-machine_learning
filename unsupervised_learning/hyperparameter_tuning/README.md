# Requirements
## General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)

    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4), but can ignore error E741
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np

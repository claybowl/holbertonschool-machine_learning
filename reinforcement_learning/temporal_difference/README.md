Assumptions:

1. Python docstring format: We will use the reStructuredText (reST) format for Python docstrings. This is a common format that is easy to read and write, and it is supported by many tools for generating documentation.

2. "Executable" files: We interpret this to mean that each Python file should be runnable as a script from the command line. This will be achieved by including a shebang line at the top of each file (#!/usr/bin/env python3), and by defining a main function in each file that executes the relevant code when the file is run as a script.

3. Parameters and returns for the algorithm functions: We assume that the parameters for each function include the environment (env), a value function or action-value function (V or Q), a policy, and various parameters controlling the algorithm's behavior (number of episodes, maximum steps per episode, learning rate alpha, discount factor gamma, trace decay parameter lambda, etc.). The functions are assumed to return the updated value function or action-value function after learning.

Based on these assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. monte_carlo.py: This file will contain the function for the Monte Carlo algorithm. The function will take the parameters described above, perform the Monte Carlo algorithm to update the value function based on the policy, and return the updated value function.

2. td_lambtha.py: This file will contain the function for the TD(位) algorithm. The function will take the parameters described above, perform the TD(位) algorithm to update the value function based on the policy, and return the updated value function.

3. sarsa_lambtha.py: This file will contain the function for the SARSA(位) algorithm. The function will take the parameters described above, perform the SARSA(位) algorithm to update the action-value function based on the policy, and return the updated action-value function.

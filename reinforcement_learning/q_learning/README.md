## Overview

This project aims to train a reinforcement learning agent to play Atari's Breakout game. We use Python 3.5 and various libraries like Gym, Keras, and Keras-RL to accomplish this. The project contains two main scripts:

- `train.py`: Trains the agent using DQN (Deep Q-Network).
- `play.py`: Allows the trained agent to play the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15
- Gym 0.17.2
- Keras 2.2.5
- Keras-RL 0.4.2

## Setting Up a Conda Environment

Conda is a package and environment management system that allows you to install software packages and manage different environments for various projects. Follow these steps to set up a Conda environment:

1. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda**: Download from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
3. **Create a New Environment**: Run `conda create --name atari_breakout python=3.5`.
4. **Activate the Environment**: Run `conda activate atari_breakout` on Windows or `source activate atari_breakout` on macOS and Linux.

For more details, check the [Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

## Installing Dependencies

After activating your Conda environment, install the required packages:

```bash
conda install numpy=1.15 gym=0.17.2
pip install keras==2.2.5 keras-rl==0.4.2

## Running the Code

    - Train the Agent: Run python train.py to train the agent. The trained model will be saved as policy.h5.
    - Play the Game: Run python play.py to see the trained agent in action.

## Troubleshooting

    - Conda Command Not Found: Make sure Anaconda/Miniconda is installed and added to your system's PATH. See detailed guide.
    - Environment Doesn't Exist: Ensure you have the correct Gym version and have installed the Atari dependencies (pip install gym[atari]).

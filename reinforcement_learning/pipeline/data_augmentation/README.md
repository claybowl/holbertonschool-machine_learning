Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What is data augmentation?
    When should you perform data augmentation?
    What are the benefits of using data augmentation?
    What are the various ways to perform data augmentation?
    How can you use ML to automate data augmentation?

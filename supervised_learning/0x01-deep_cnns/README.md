 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a skip connection?
What is a bottleneck layer?
What is the Inception Network?
What is ResNet? ResNeXt? DenseNet?
How to replicate a network architecture by reading a journal article
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import tensorflow.keras as K
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
